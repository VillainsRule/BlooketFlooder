<br>
<h2 align="center">disclaimer</h2>

any reprocussions coming from usage of this tool aren't my fault or my issue, so don't bug me.<br>
i'd recommend using a vpn when doing things like spamming the sh*t outta Blooket's API.

<br>
<h2 align="center">speed</h2>

firebase has a native JS sdk which the program uses to connect to games, which doesn't support proxies (for "security reasons").<br>
if someone finds some fork that does, pls open an [issue](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) or [pr](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/pulls).

<br>
<h2 align="center">credit</h2>

i stole the firebase join info from [konz](https://gitlab.com/blooket).<br>
other than that bit, i coded the script.
