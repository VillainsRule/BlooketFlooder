<h2 align="center">bug reports</h2>

use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
explain as much of the issue as possible, and send screenshots.<br>
this literally took me 30 minutes, expect bugs.

<br>
<h2 align="center">disclaimer</h2>

any reprocussions coming from usage of this tool aren't my fault or my issue, so don't bug me.<br>
i'd recommend using a vpn when spamming Blooket's API.

<br>
<h2 align="center">speed</h2>

firebase has a native JS sdk which we use to connect, which doesn't support proxies (for "security reasons").<br>
if someone finds some fork that does, pls open an [issue](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) or [pr](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/pulls).

<br>
<h2 align="center">credit</h2>

i stole the firebase join info from [konz](https://github.com/05konz).<br>
