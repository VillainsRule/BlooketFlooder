## installation
bit hard, but oh well.

### prerequisites
> [!NOTE]
> you must be running the script in an environment that allows you to open, close, and manipulate windows.<br>
> examples of valid environments: desktop macos, desktop windows, most linux distros<br>
> examples of invalid environments: github codespaces, codesandbox, codeanywhere (NONE OF THESE HAVE ACTUAL WINDOWS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LINUX USERS:**<br>
> you must install xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`

### common instructions
1. install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder && cd BlooketFlooder`
3. install dependencies: `npm i`

### normal modes
normal mode is all games not tagged as beta (everything created in 2024 and earlier).<br>
run this using: `node normal` OR `node .`

### beta modes
if you are trying to join a game that is tagged as "BETA" (most 2025 gamemodes)<br>
run this using: `node beta`

the odds this becomes a web app are very small. maybe someday!

<br>

## bug reports
use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
it is helpful to assume that you are always the issue rather than an anticheat.<br>
following this logic, you should try to explain as much as possible with a couple screenshots.
