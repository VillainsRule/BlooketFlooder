    <h3>a fast blooket game botter that bypasses all modern antibots.</h3>

## installation
bit hard, but oh well.

### prerequisites
> [!NOTE]
> you must be running the script in an environment that allows you to open, close, and manipulate windows.<br>
> examples of valid environments: desktop macos, desktop windows, linux with window managers<br>
> examples of invalid environments: github codespaces, codesandbox, codeanywhere (NONE OF THESE HAVE ACTUAL WINDOWS)<br>
> you can bypass this with premium! ✨

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LINUX USERS:**<br>
> you must install xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`<br>
> you can bypass this with premium! ✨

### common instructions
1. install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder && cd BlooketFlooder`
3. install dependencies: `npm i`

### normal modes
normal mode is all games that haven't been recoded (currently gold quest/crypto hack/fishing frenzy)<br>
run this using: `node normal` OR `node .`

### beta modes
if you are trying to join a game that is not listed under normal above<br>
run this using: `node beta`

<br>

if you try to make this a web app, you will probably be DDOSed, as this uses up a lot of resources on your system. go premium ✨ for lower resource consumption!

<br>

## bug reports
use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
it is helpful to assume that you are always the issue rather than an anticheat.<br>
following this logic, you should try to explain as much as possible with a couple screenshots.
