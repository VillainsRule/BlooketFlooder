    <h3>a fast blooket game botter that bypasses all modern antibots.</h3>

## installation
bit hard, but oh well.

### prerequisites
if you are on a linux system, you will have to install xvfb using `sudo apt-get install xvfb`. this is a dependency of [puppeteer-real-browser](https://github.com/ZFC-Digital/puppeteer-real-browser), which is used to bypass one of the multiple antibots. otherwise, skip this step

### common instructions
1. install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder && cd BlooketFlooder`
3. install dependencies: `npm i`

### normal modes
normal mode is all games not tagged as beta (so everything except "laser" atm).<br>
to run normal, the command is `node normal` or `node .` - no added setup is required

### beta modes
if you are trying to join a game that is "BETA" (so just laser atm), the command is `node beta`<br>
this has a refreshed and overhauled interface with interactive inputs that look much nicer.

eventually this might be open to use as a web app. we'll see!

## bug reports
use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
explain as much of the issue as possible, and send screenshots.<br>
blooket patches these things sometimes, it can happen.
