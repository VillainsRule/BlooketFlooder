    <h1>Blooket Flooder</h1>
    <h3>a fast blooket game botter that bypasses all modern antibots.</h3>

<br>
<h2 align="center">installation</h2>

1. install [bun](https://bun.sh)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder && cd BlooketFlooder`
3. install dependencies: `bun i`
4. run it! `bun .`

if you are on a linux system, you will have to install xvfb using `sudo apt-get install xvfb`.<br>
this is a dependency of [puppeteer-real-browser](https://github.com/ZFC-Digital/puppeteer-real-browser), which is used to bypass the antibot.

eventually this might be open to use as a web app. we'll see!

<br>
<h2 align="center">bug reports</h2>

use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
explain as much of the issue as possible, and send screenshots.<br>
blooket patches these things sometimes, it can happen.

<br>
<h2 align="center">speed</h2>

firebase has a native JS sdk which the program uses to connect to games, which doesn't support proxies (for "security reasons").<br>
if someone finds some fork that does, pls open an [issue](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) or [pr](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/pulls).
