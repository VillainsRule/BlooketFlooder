bit hard, but oh well.

> examples of invalid environments: github codespaces, codesandbox, codeanywhere (NONE OF THESE HAVE ACTUAL WINDOWS)<br>
> this is not required with BF pro! ✨

> [!IMPORTANT]

> you must install xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`<br>
> this is not required with BF pro! ✨

### common instructions
1. install [bun](https://bun.sh)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder && cd BlooketFlooder`
3. install dependencies: `bun i`

if you understand the concept of colyseus rewritten modes, use `bun beta` for rewritten modes and `bun legacy` for legacy modes.<br>

if not, run `bun .` to get your hand held until you understand!

<br>

## bug reports
use the [issues](https://github.com/VillainsRule/BlooketFlooder/issues) tab.<br>
it is helpful to assume that you are always the issue rather than an anticheat.<br>
following this logic, you should try to explain as much as possible with a couple screenshots.
